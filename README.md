# 🌸 Welcome to My World  

This is a simple **personal fan page** created using **HTML & CSS** as part of my Rapid Assignment.  
It’s inspired by my love for music, nature and K-pop group StrayKids 💜🌊✨  

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 Colorful layout with sections (header, navigation, content, footer)  
- 📌 Navigation bar with Home, About Me, and Gallery  
- 📝 Personal introduction with emojis  
- 📷 Space for adding a gallery  

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Make it responsive for mobile  
- Add an About Me page and Gallery page  
- Add CSS animations or JavaScript interactivity
